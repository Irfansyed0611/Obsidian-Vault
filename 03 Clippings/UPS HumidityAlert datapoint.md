## Formula Breakdown

The formula is structured as follows:

```
if(lt(RemoteHumidity, RemoteHumidityUpperLimit),
   if(gt(RemoteHumidity, RemoteHumidityLowerLimit), 40, RemoteHumidity),
   RemoteHumidity)
```

## Components Explained

1. **Outer `if` Statement**:

- **Condition**: `lt(RemoteHumidity, RemoteHumidityUpperLimit)` checks if the remote humidity is less than the upper limit.
- **True Case**: If true, it evaluates the inner `if` statement.
- **False Case**: If false, it simply returns the current value of `RemoteHumidity`.
2. **Inner `if` Statement**:

- **Condition**: `gt(RemoteHumidity, RemoteHumidityLowerLimit)` checks if the remote humidity is greater than the lower limit.
- **True Case**: If true, it returns a fixed value of **40**.
- **False Case**: If false, it returns the current value of `RemoteHumidity`.

## What It Calculates

- The formula effectively sets a threshold mechanism for humidity readings:

- If the humidity is below the upper limit:

- If it is also above the lower limit, it defaults to a value of **40**.
- If it is not above the lower limit, it retains the current humidity value.
- If the humidity exceeds or meets the upper limit, it returns the actual humidity reading.

## Purpose in UPS Monitoring

In the context of UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) monitoring within LogicMonitor:

- This formula helps ensure that humidity levels are monitored within safe operational limits.
- By setting a minimum threshold (returning 40 when conditions are met), it can trigger alerts or actions when environmental conditions are not optimal for equipment operation.
- This kind of monitoring is crucial for maintaining equipment reliability and preventing failures due to environmental factors like excessive humidity.

In summary, this formula provides a mechanism to manage and respond to varying humidity levels in a *monitored* environment, which is essential for effective UPS management and overall system health.
