## CPU usage through vCenter host performance
### Definition

Represents the percentage of real time that the physical CPU (PCPU) was not idle. It provides:

- **Raw PCPU Utilization**: The percentage of CPU usage for each physical CPU.   
- **Average Utilization**: The average utilization across all physical CPUs.
### Context 

Focuses on actual physical CPU usage, which is useful for hardware-level monitoring. It accounts for the time the physical CPU is actively processing tasks.

### Impact of Power Management/Hyper-Threading 

CPU utilization might differ due to technologies like hyper-threading or power management, which can affect how physical CPUs are utilized.

## CPU usage from the host CPU datasource

### Definition 

Represents the percent utilization of the CPU averaged over the last 20 seconds. This is a broader metric that smooths out fluctuations by averaging usage over a short time window.

### Context 

Provides a more general view of CPU activity over time, making it suitable for identifying trends or spikes in utilization.

### Impact of Power Management/Hyper-Threading 

Similarly, CPU usage and utilization might differ due to these technologies, but this metric focuses on a time-based average rather than instantaneous raw usage.

## Key Differences

|Feature|Statement 1 (PCPU UTIL(%))|Statement 2 (Percent Utilization Over Last 20 Seconds)|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Physical CPUs (PCPUs)|Overall CPU utilization averaged over time|
|**Time Frame**|Instantaneous|Averaged over 20 seconds|
|**Granularity**|Per-PCPU and overall average|General percent utilization|
|**Use Case**|Hardware-level monitoring|Trend analysis or workload monitoring|
