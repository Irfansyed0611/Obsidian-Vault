Multi-stage Docker builds are particularly useful for applications that need to separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies. Here are the main use cases:

## **1. Compiled Language Applications**

### Go, C++, Rust, Java

```docker
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.19 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Runtime stage
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /usr/local/bin/
CMD ["myapp"]

```

**Why:** Compiler and build tools aren't needed in production, significantly reducing image size. In languages like `go`, the code compiles into a lightweight executable, substantially decreasing the final image size.

## **2. Frontend Applications**

### React, Angular, Vue.js

```docker
# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

```

**Why:** Node.js and build tools (webpack, babel) are only needed during build time.

## **3. Applications with Heavy Build Dependencies**

### Machine Learning Models, Data Processing

```docker
# Build stage with heavy dependencies
FROM python:3.9 AS builder
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\\
    build-essential \\\\
    cmake \\\\
    git
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --no-deps --wheel-dir /wheels -r requirements.txt

# Slim runtime
FROM python:3.9-slim
COPY --from=builder /wheels /wheels
RUN pip install --no-cache /wheels/*

```

## **4. CI/CD Pipeline Optimization**

- **Testing stage**: Run tests in one stage
- **Security scanning**: Scan in another stage
- **Production build**: Final optimized stage

```docker
# Test stage
FROM node:18 AS tester
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci && npm test

# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci && npm run build

# Production
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

```

## **5. Legacy Application Modernization**

Applications requiring specific build environments but running in modern containers:

- Old compiler versions for building
- Modern, secure base images for runtime

## **Key Benefits:**

- **Smaller images**: Production images only contain runtime necessities
- **Better security**: Fewer packages = smaller attack surface
- **Faster deployments**: Smaller images transfer and start faster
- **Clean separation**: Build tools stay in build stage
- **Cost savings**: Less storage and bandwidth usage

Multi-stage builds are essentially beneficial for any application where the build environment is significantly different from the runtime environment.
