Rotating AWS access keys is a crucial security practice to minimize the risk of compromised credentials. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to rotate access keys for an IAM user using the AWS CLI.

Example
Step 1: Create a Second Access Key

Create a new access key for the user.
```sh
aws iam create-access-key --user-name Alice
```

Step 2: Update Applications
Update all your applications to use the new access key and validate that they are working correctly.

Step 3: Deactivate the Old Access Key
Deactivate the old access key.
```sh
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE --status Inactive --user-name Alice
```

Step 4: Validate Applications
Ensure that your applications are still functioning as expected with the new access key.

Step 5: Delete the Old Access Key
Delete the inactive access key.
```sh
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE --user-name Alice
```

Important Considerations
- **Security Best Practices**: Regularly rotating your IAM credentials helps prevent unauthorized access.
- **Automation**: Consider using AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Lambda for automated key rotation.
- **Validation**: Always validate that your applications are working correctly after updating the keys.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AWS environment remains secure and compliant with best practices
