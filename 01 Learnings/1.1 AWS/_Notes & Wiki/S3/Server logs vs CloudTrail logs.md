It's important to understand that S3 Server Access Logs and AWS CloudTrail data events serve different, though sometimes overlapping, purposes when monitoring S3 activity. Here's a breakdown of their key differences:

**S3 Server Access Logs:**

- **Focus:**
    - Primarily focused on logging access requests to S3 objects.1 Think of it as web server-style logs.
    - Provides detailed information about requests made directly to the S3 bucket's data.2
- **Granularity:**
    - Operates at the S3 bucket level.3 You enable it per bucket.4
- **Information:**
    - Includes details like requester IP address, request time, HTTP status codes, and object sizes.5
    - Can provide information that CloudTrail does not, such as HTTP referrers, and turn around times.6
- **Cost:**
    - Relatively low cost, primarily the cost of storing the log files in S3.7
- **Use Cases:**
    - Analyzing object access patterns.
    - Troubleshooting access issues.
    - Detailed auditing of object-level activity.8

**AWS CloudTrail Data Events:**

- **Focus:**
    - Logs API calls related to data operations within S3.
    - Track
    - s object-level API activity (e.g., GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject).9
- **Granularity:**
    - Can be configured at the AWS account level or for specific S3 buckets or even prefixes within buckets.10
- **Information:**
    - Records API call details, including the caller, time, and API action.11
    - Provides valuable information for compliance and security auditing.12
- **Cost:**
    - Incurs additional costs, especially with high volumes of data events.13
- **Use Cases:**
    - Compliance auditing.
    - Security analysis and incident response.
    - Tracking data modifications.

**Key Distinctions:**

- **Level of Detail:**
    - S3 Server Access Logs offer more granular details about individual access requests.
    - CloudTrail focuses on the API calls.
- **Scope:**
    - S3 access logs are bucket specific.14
    - Cloudtrail data events can be account wide, or more granular.15
- **Cost:**
    - Cloudtrail data events have a higher cost associated with them.

**In essence:**

- Use S3 Server Access Logs for detailed tracking of object access.
- Use CloudTrail data events for comprehensive auditing of API activity and compliance.16

It is common to use both logging methods in conjunction, to have a more complete view of the activity that is happening within your S3 environment.
