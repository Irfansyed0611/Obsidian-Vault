Some people receive significantly more recruiter calls from Naukri due to strategic **profile optimization** and understanding how the platform's algorithm works.[gururo+2](https://gururo.com/naukri-profile-improvements/)

## Key Factors That Make Profiles Stand Out

## Star Rating System

Naukri uses a **star rating system** (1-5 stars) to rank profile relevance for specific jobs, and by default, only 4-5 star profiles are visible to most recruiters. The algorithm evaluates profiles based on job title, experience, location, keywords, and other parameters to assign these ratings.[recruiterzone.naukri+2](https://recruiterzone.naukri.com/star-rating-filter-get-relevant-responses-smartly/)

## Profile Completeness and Activity

Successful candidates maintain **100% profile completion** and update their profiles daily between 9-10 AM. Making minor changes like editing the headline or re-uploading the resume keeps the profile active in Naukri's algorithm.[linkedin+2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itshb_tricks-to-optimize-your-naukricom-profile-activity-7213251763322114049-KJgN)

## Strategic Keyword Usage

High-performing profiles incorporate **relevant keywords** throughout their resume headline, profile summary, and key skills sections. These keywords should match job descriptions in your target field and include both technical skills and role-specific terms.[linkedin+4](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bigdatabysumit_7-powerful-tips-to-10x-your-naukri-profile-activity-7293178404579786752-mJU7)

## What Top Performers Do Better

## Resume Headline Optimization

Effective profiles use compelling, **keyword-rich headlines** that immediately convey their value proposition, such as "Data analyst with 3 years of experience in SQL, Python, Tableau, advanced MS Excel" instead of generic titles.[linkedin+2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-get-more-interview-calls-from-naukri-linkedin-nale-0z93f)

## Salary Strategy

Many successful job seekers set their **preferred salary to 0** to attract more recruiters who might otherwise filter them out based on budget constraints. They also ensure notice periods don't exceed 2 months.[linkedin+1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itshb_tricks-to-optimize-your-naukricom-profile-activity-7213251763322114049-KJgN)

## Regular Application Activity

Consistently applying for jobs using relevant keywords improves algorithm visibility, as Naukri's system prioritizes active users. Early applications to new job postings also increase visibility chances.[linkedin+1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bigdatabysumit_7-powerful-tips-to-10x-your-naukri-profile-activity-7293178404579786752-mJU7)

## Premium Services Impact

Those struggling with calls often benefit from Naukri's **paid subscription services**, which can boost profile visibility up to 3 times in recruiter searches. Premium features like Priority Applicant service help highlight applications and provide faster recruiter responses.youtube[resume.naukri+1](https://resume.naukri.com/priority-job-application)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Less successful profiles often have **incomplete information**, generic headlines, outdated skills, or notice periods exceeding company preferences. They may also lack proper **ATS optimization** with clean formatting, relevant keywords, and quantified achievements.[novoresume+3](https://novoresume.com/career-blog/resume-keywords-how-to-use-them)

The key difference lies in understanding that Naukri operates as a sophisticated matching algorithm that rewards active, keyword-optimized, and complete profiles while prioritizing candidates who demonstrate immediate availability and relevant skills for specific roles.[recruiterzone.naukri+1](https://recruiterzone.naukri.com/identify-relevant-applies-with-great-ease/)
