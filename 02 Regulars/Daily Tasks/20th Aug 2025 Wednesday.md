## Notes

Hi Tim,

We’ve recently received a few alerts from LogicMonitor that included Trusted Advisor recommendations for Caribou AWS accounts. To address this, we’ve created a detailed report containing all the recommendations from AWS Trusted Advisor. Please find the document attached.

Would you be open to scheduling a call to review and discuss these recommendations?
