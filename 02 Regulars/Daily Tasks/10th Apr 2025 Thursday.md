## Notes

### Linux OS level encryption

- Does LUKS encryption happen on the OS level?
- What will happen if EC2 instance is encrypted through KMS?
- If LUKS is enabled then is it possible to detach the volume and re-attach somewhere?

Hi Vijay / Lava,

Thanks for proving us access to VIR OKTA. But I don't see AWS tile here. Can you please get me access like rest of the team members.
