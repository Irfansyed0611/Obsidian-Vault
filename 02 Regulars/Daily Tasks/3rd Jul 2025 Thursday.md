## Notes

Hi Cleatus,

As part of the Si-Bone Linux T&M project, I have completed the following tasks
- Installed R7 and Crowdstike agent in CS-R7Connector, R7-IVM-SE and R7-IVM-SC servers.
- Enabled Linux Auditd Compatibility Mode in CS-R7Connector server.
I haven't received any other request. Can we consider this projects as closed?
